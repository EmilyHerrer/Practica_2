        <h2>The Beach</h2>
        <p>The Beach is located to the south of Pelican Town. 
            It is a valuable area for fishing as it is one of the few sources for saltwater fish. 
            In addition, many shells and forageable items can be found washed up on the beach, especially during Summer 12-14.</p>
        <p>In Summer, the Luau and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies festivals are held on the beach.
            In Winter, the Night Market is held on the pier from the 15th to the 17th.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Tide Pools</h3>
        <p>The tide pools are found at the east end of the beach, and are the primary place to find Coral and Sea Urchins. 
            At the start of the game, the wooden footbridge across the river is broken. 
            Until the bridge is repaired (requiring 300 pieces of wood) or the second community upgrade is purchased, the tide pools are inaccessible.</p>
        <p>On rainy or stormy days, the Old Mariner stands at the north side of the beach past the tide pools.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Tide Pool Foraging</h3>
        <p>Several special items appear (normally) only in the tide pool region east of the bridge. 
            These items spawn separately from the standard forage items, and therefore do not count as part of the six item per map limit.</p>
        <p><img src="La playa/Coral.png" alt=""/><strong>Coral</strong> and  <img src="La playa/Sea_Urchin.png" alt=""/> <strong>Sea Urchins</strong> can spawn throughout the tide pool area (shown in blue on the map).
            There is no hard limit on the number of either item.
            The average spawn rate for all tide pool items is 1.2 items per night;[5] unlike standard forageables, this rate does not increase on Sunday mornings or the first day of a season.
            20% of all tide pool items will be Sea Urchins, and 80% Corals. 
            Some of the Coral and Sea Urchins that spawn can be overlooked, because they may be present in the semi-obscured tiles behind the bush-like sea anemones found by the tide pools.</p>
        <p><img src="La playa/Seaweed.png" alt=""/> <strong>Seaweed</strong> can also spawn near the tide pools, but only in a narrow strip right by the shore (shown in green on the map). 
            There is a 3% chance per night of Seaweed spawning.</p>
