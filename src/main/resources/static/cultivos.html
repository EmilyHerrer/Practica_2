        <h2><strong>Crops</strong></h2>
        <p>Crops are plants that are grown from seeds to be harvested for the purpose of profit, food, or gifting. Generally, each crop is seasonal. 
            It can be planted only during its designated season, and when seasons change (after the 28th day), the crop will wither and die. 
            Multi-season crops (i.e., Ancient Fruit, Coffee Bean, Corn, Sunflower, and Wheat), however, will continue to grow during all specified seasons.</p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Giant Crops</h3>
        <p>Cauliflower, Melons, or Pumpkins planted in a 3x3 pattern can randomly combine into a giant crop.
            Giant crops drop 15â€“21 normal-quality items when harvested with any axe, taking three hits.</p>
        <p>At the start of each day, every possible 3x3 grid of crops (including overlaps) has a 1% chance to grow into a giant crop as long as the center crop is fully-grown and watered, and all constituent crops are of the same type.
            Giant crops won't necessarily appear on the day the crops finish growing; it can happen any day those criteria are met.</p>
        <p>Giant crops don't die at change of season like other crops. 
            Soil underneath a giant crop may become untilled, causing any fertilizer to be lost.
            Giant crops cannot grow in the greenhouse, by using Garden Pots, or on Ginger Island.</p>

        <p>Valuable, but slow-growing. Despite its pale color, the florets are packed with nutrients.</p>
