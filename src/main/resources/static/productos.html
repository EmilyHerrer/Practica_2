        <h2>Artisan Goods</h2>
        <p><strong>Artisan Goods</strong> are items that can be created using Artisan Equipment. 
            They can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (in-game time) to be processed. 
            Most Artisan Goods do not have a star quality, so the star quality of the ingredients used is ignored. 
            The only exception is the Ostrich Egg, the star quality of whose artisan product will match that of the ingredient.</p>
        <p>If the Artisan Profession is chosen after reaching level 10 Farming, Artisan Goods will be worth 40% more (with the exception of Oil and Coffee). 
            Tree Syrups (Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, and Pine Tar) do not benefit from the Artisan Profession, and are not included here. 
            They are labeled as "Artisan Goods" in-game, however. 
            (Their value is instead affected by the Tapper Profession.)</p>

        <h3>Processing Time</h3>
        <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p>One hour = 60 minutes from 6am to 2am, but 1 hour = 100 minutes from 2am to 6am.</p>
        <br> 
        <h3>Production Machines</h3> 
        <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Production machines make products over time without any additional input.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Bee House</h4>
        <p>A Bee House produces Wild Honey every 4 days.</p>
        <p>The Bee House can produce unique types of honey when it is in range of a blooming flower (within 5 tiles in any cardinal direction). 
            When there is more than one type of flower within range, the closest flower takes priority.</p>
        <p>Bee houses can be placed inside the Greenhouse, but will not produce honey. 
            Flowers placed in garden pots will also not cause bee houses to produce flower honey.</p>

        <h3>Processing Machines</h3>
        <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Processing machines take one item and turn it into another item after some time, usually of greater value. 
            Unlike production machines, processing machines require the player to input an item.</p>
        <h4>Cask</h4>
        <p>A Cask takes specific products and ages them to increase quality and value. 
            The aging speed varies between products. 
            Wine takes the longest: 2 seasons of aging to go from basic wine to iridium quality wine.</p>
